# Kleo — A Creative Archive for the Feeling Mind

Kleo is a soulful reinvention of the calendar — one that blurs the line between memory and planning, productivity and presence. It's not just about managing time. It's about experiencing it.

> ✦ Plan your days like stories.  
> ✦ Add memories, not just meetings.  
> ✦ Archive what matters — in color, sound, and feeling.

## 🌀 Vision

We’re building Kleo for artists, deep feelers, and memory hoarders — for those who live richly and want tools that reflect that. A space where time is not just a timeline, but a tapestry.

Kleo merges:

- 🧠 _AI that adapts to your emotional and temporal rhythm_
- 🎨 _Zine-style visual layouts_
- 🎞️ _Multimedia memory entries and intelligent storytelling features_

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains the **second iteration** of Kleo — following a creative and strategic pivot.

The **first MVP** (Sep 2024 – Feb 2025) was a full-stack, AI-powered calendar. While fully functional, the direction didn’t reflect the emotional depth the product was meant to carry. The old codebase has been deprecated and is not included in this repo.
